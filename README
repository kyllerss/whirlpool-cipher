== whirlpool-cipher

This project is meant to be a pure Ruby implementation of the Whirlpool cipher
that focuses on illustrating the different steps in the cipher. As such,
code clarity is the main focus of this implementation. Performance considerations
of the implementation are minimally kept in mind.

One aspect of this project that will stand out from other implementations
is that I will try not to rely on hardcoded constants for each of the steps. While these
constants are a good thing to have hardcoded into the implementation for performance
reasons, they contribute little to understanding how the algorithm actually works.

Bare with me as the project evolves into something that can actually be used.

For the time being this project will be prioritized in the following ways:

1) get a working implementation up and running,
2) add algorithm-centric documentation,
3) remove all constants that can be derived algorithmically,
4) clean up structure of project, and
5) fix bugs/documentation
